          My name is Artem Salatsky, I come from Ukraine, from the city of Kyiv. I am 18 years old, born on March 20,
        2007.I graduated from a 3-level lyceum, 11 grades, studied at Kamensky University in Bratislava, now I study at VIA
        University. I know how to use Blender3D, I have some knowledge of the following programming languages: C++,
        Python, Java, HTML, CSS. I have 2 main hobbies, Street Workout and Warhammer in general. I have been in Street
        Workout for quite a long time and if I count from 0 to 10, then I have reached approximately 3.5/10. My favorite
        elements are "Deathmatch" and "360". In Warhammer I want to highlight that in the tabletop version there are 2
        large armies: space marines, gnomes. And I also want to highlight the game Dawn of War Soulstorm, now Definitive
        edition. At the moment, I am in the top 5 of the rankings for my faction and play consistently in tournaments,
        although my level is not yet high enough to enter the top 3 tournaments.
