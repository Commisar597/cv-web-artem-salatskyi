          <p> My name is Artem Salatsky, and I am from Kyiv, Ukraine. I am 18 years old, born on March 20, 2007. I graduated
        from a three-level lyceum after completing 11 grades and later studied at Kamensky University in Bratislava. I
        am currently pursuing my studies at VIA University.</p>
          <p> I am proficient in Blender3D and possess foundational knowledge of several programming languages, including C++,
        Python, Java, HTML, and CSS.</p>
          <p> My main interests are Street Workout and Warhammer. I have been engaged in Street Workout for several years and
        would assess my current level at approximately 3.5 on a scale from 0 to 10. My favorite elements are
        “Deathmatch” and “360.”</p>
          <p> Warhammer, on the other hand, enables me to integrate my diverse interests — creativity, handcrafting,
        storytelling, and strategic planning. In the tabletop version, I collect two major armies: Space Marines and
        Dwarves. Additionally, I am an active player of Dawn of War: Soulstorm – Definitive Edition, where I currently
        hold a position within the top five players of my faction and regularly participate in tournaments. Although I
        am not yet among the top three competitors, I continue to improve and compete consistently.</p>
